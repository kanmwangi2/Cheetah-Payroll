  - RWF 60,001 - 100,000: 10%
  - RWF 100,001 - 200,000: 20%

- **Calculation Method**: Progressive (cumulative brackets)

#### 2. **Pension Contribution**

- **Employer Rate**: 8% of total gross pay
- **Employee Rate**: 6% of total gross pay
- **Calculation Basis**: Total gross pay
- **Total Contribution**: 14% (8% employer + 6% employee)

#### 3. **Maternity Contribution**

- **Employer Rate**: 0.3% of qualifying gross pay
- **Employee Rate**: 0.3% of qualifying gross pay
- **Calculation Basis**: Total gross pay excluding transport allowance
- **Total Contribution**: 0.6% (0.3% employer + 0.3% employee)

#### 4. **CBHI (Community Based Health Insurance)**

- **Employee Rate**: 7.5% of basic pay
- **Calculation Basis**: Basic pay only (excludes allowances)
- **Total Contribution**: 15% (7.5% employer + 7.5% employee)

### Tax Calculation Sequence

The payroll calculation engine follows this specific order:

1. **Start with Total Gross Pay** (Basic Pay + All Allowances)
2. **Calculate PAYE** (Progressive brackets on Total Gross Pay)
3. **Calculate Pension** (14% total: 8% employer + 6% employee on Total Gross Pay)
4. **Calculate Maternity** (0.6% total: 0.3% employer + 0.3% employee on Total Gross Pay excluding
   transport)
5. **Calculate RAMA** (15% total: 7.5% employer + 7.5% employee on Basic Pay only)
6. **Calculate Net Salary** (Gross Pay - Employee PAYE - Employee Pension - Employee Maternity -
   Employee RAMA)
7. **Calculate CBHI** (0.5% employee on Net Salary before CBHI)
8. **Final Net Pay** (Net Salary - CBHI - Other Deductions)

    maternity_employee, maternity_employer, rama_employee, rama_employer,
    cbhi_employee, other_deductions, final_net_pay, created_at, updated_at

/app_settings/tax_brackets
  - paye_brackets: [
      {min: 0, max: 60000, rate: 0},
      {min: 60001, max: 100000, rate: 10},

### Gross-up Calculation Algorithm

```
Input: Net Amount, Tax Rates, Other Deductions
Output: Gross Amount

Algorithm: Binary Search Method for Complex Tax Structure
1. Set lower bound = Net Amount
2. Set upper bound = Net Amount * 2.5 (accounting for Rwanda's 30% top PAYE rate)
3. While (upper bound - lower bound > precision tolerance):
   a. Calculate middle point (potential gross)
   b. Apply Rwanda tax sequence:
      - Calculate PAYE using progressive brackets
      - Calculate Pension (6% employee on gross)
      - Calculate Maternity (0.3% employee on gross excluding transport)
      - Calculate RAMA (7.5% employee on basic pay portion)
      - Calculate intermediate net
      - Calculate CBHI (0.5% on intermediate net)
      - Calculate final net after all deductions
   c. If resulting net > target net: upper bound = middle point
   d. If resulting net < target net: lower bound = middle point
4. Return converged gross amount

Special Considerations:
- Handle progressive PAYE brackets correctly
- Account for different calculation bases (gross vs basic pay vs net)
- Apply calculation sequence as per Rwanda tax law
